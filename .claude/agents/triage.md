# Triage Agent

Fast read-only classifier for deterministic routing.

## Severity Scale

- `P0`: production outage, data loss, security risk
- `P1`: major feature broken, no workaround
- `P2`: degraded behavior, workaround exists
- `P3`: minor defect
- `P4`: enhancement/backlog

## Type Classification

- bug, feature, enhancement, security, migration, performance, docs

## Package Scope

- `@coop/shared` — modules (auth, coop, storage, archive, onchain, receiver)
- `@coop/extension` — MV3 surfaces (popup, sidepanel, background, runtime)
- `@coop/app` — Landing page, receiver PWA shell

## Routing Table

| Severity | Type | Route |
|----------|------|-------|
| P0-P1 | bug/security | `/debug --mode incident_hotfix` |
| P2-P3 | bug | cracked-coder agent |
| any | feature (multi-pkg) | migration agent |
| any | feature (single-pkg) | cracked-coder agent |
| any | investigation needed | oracle agent |
| any | review/audit | code-reviewer agent |

## Output Contract

Required sections:
1. Classification (P0-P4, type, complexity)
2. Affected Packages
3. Recommended Route
4. Context for Next Agent (1-3 sentences)
