# Plan Skill

Planning lifecycle for Coop: create plans, check progress, execute in batches.

**References**: See `CLAUDE.md` for entry points, agent routing, and Coop conventions.

---

## Activation

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/plan` | Create new implementation plan |
| `/plan --mode check` | Audit progress against plan |
| `/plan --mode execute` | Execute plan in batches |
| `/plan --mode cleanup` | Audit `.plans/` — archive implemented, flag stale |
| `/plan --mode teams*` | Team-lane orchestration modes |
| `/teams*` | Legacy alias routed to `/plan --mode teams*` |
| Starting new feature | Create plan before coding |

## Progress Tracking (REQUIRED)

Use **TodoWrite** for visibility when available. If unavailable, keep a Markdown checklist in the response. See `CLAUDE.md` -> Session Continuity.

## Part 1: Create Plan

### Phase 1: Understanding & Validation

1. **Extract ALL requirements** from issue/task
2. **Map each requirement** to planned steps
3. **Audit codebase** — search for existing patterns
4. **Review CLAUDE.md** for compliance rules

### Phase 2: Plan Structure

Use kebab-case: `[descriptive-name].todo.md` in `.plans/`

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

**GitHub Issue**: #[number]
**Branch**: `feature/branch-name`
**Status**: ACTIVE | BLOCKED | IMPLEMENTED | SUPERSEDED
**Supersedes**: [link to old plan if applicable]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Decision Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Choice made | Why this over alternatives |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Planned Step | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| User can X  | Step 3       |        |

## CLAUDE.md Compliance
- [ ] Modules in shared package
- [ ] Barrel imports from @coop/shared
- [ ] Single root .env only

## Impact Analysis

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description

### Files to Create
- `path/to/new-file.ts`

## Test Strategy
- **Unit tests**: What gets tested, expected coverage delta
- **Integration tests**: Cross-package or workflow tests needed
- **E2E tests**: User-facing flows to verify

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Action]
**Files**: `path/to/file.ts`
**Details**: Specific changes

## Validation
- [ ] TypeScript passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
```

### Task Decomposition Rules

Implementation steps must be granular enough for agents to execute reliably. Follow these heuristics:

**Step sizing**:
- Each step should be completable in a single agent session (~15-25 tool calls)
- Each step should touch at most 3-4 files
- If a step has more than 3 sub-bullets of changes, it's probably two steps
- If you can't describe verification for a step in one sentence, it's too big

**Independence**:
- Each step should be independently verifiable (can run tests after just that step)
- Each step should produce a committable checkpoint (no half-finished states)
- Steps should have clear input/output boundaries — what exists before, what exists after

**Ordering**:
- Follow dependency order: shared -> app -> extension
- Within a package: types/interfaces first, then implementation, then tests, then wiring
- Infrastructure steps (new files, new exports) before behavior steps (logic, handlers)

**When to decompose further**:
- A step requires changes across 3+ packages -> split into per-package steps
- A step has both "create new thing" and "integrate into existing thing" -> split those apart
- A plan exceeds 15 steps -> consider splitting into multiple PRs or incremental plans

**When NOT to decompose**:
- A step is a single-file edit with clear intent -> keep it atomic
- Splitting would create steps that can't be independently tested -> keep them together
- The decomposition adds overhead without improving clarity

## Part 2: Check Progress

1. **Load plan** from `.plans/`
2. **Gather git context**: `git status`, `git diff --stat`
3. **File-by-file status**: DONE / PARTIAL / NOT DONE
4. **Requirements coverage table**
5. **Run validation**: `bun format && bun lint && bun run test && bun build`

---

## Part 3: Execute Plan

### Batch Execution

**Default batch size**: 3 tasks

```
LOAD -> EXECUTE BATCH -> REPORT -> PAUSE -> CONTINUE/FINISH
```

### Batch Report

```markdown
## Batch [N] Complete

### Tasks Completed
1. Step 1: [Description]
   - Files: `path/to/file.ts`

### Next Batch Preview
- Steps 4, 5, 6

**Awaiting feedback before continuing...**
```

### Safety Rules

- **Stop when blocked** — Don't guess
- **No forcing through** — Never skip failing tests
- **Pause between batches** — Wait for feedback

---

## Part 4: GitHub Integration

### Link Issue to Plan

```markdown
# Plan Header
**GitHub Issue**: #123
**Closes**: #123
```

### Update Progress

```bash
gh issue comment [NUMBER] --body "## Progress: Steps 1-3 complete"
```

### On Completion

```bash
gh issue close [NUMBER] --comment "All steps complete, PR ready"
```

---

## Part 5: Plan Lifecycle Management

Plans are living documents, not write-once artifacts. Unmanaged plans accumulate and create confusion about what's current.

### Status Transitions

```
ACTIVE -> IMPLEMENTED    (code shipped, plan is historical)
ACTIVE -> SUPERSEDED     (new plan replaces this one)
ACTIVE -> BLOCKED        (waiting on external dependency)
BLOCKED -> ACTIVE        (dependency resolved)
```

### Lifecycle Rules

1. **Supersedes header**: When a new plan replaces an old one, the new plan MUST include `**Supersedes**: [old-plan-name.md]` in its header. Delete the old plan immediately.

2. **One canonical plan per feature**: Never have 2+ active plans for the same feature area. If you're writing a v2 plan, delete or archive v1 first.

3. **Status updates on implementation**: When work ships that partially or fully implements a plan, update the plan's `**Status**` and `**Last Updated**` headers. If fully implemented, delete the plan.

4. **Divergence notes**: If implementation diverges from the plan (different approach, dropped scope), add a `## Implementation Notes` section explaining what changed and why. Don't leave the plan as-if it was followed when it wasn't.

5. **Stale plan cleanup** (`/plan cleanup`): Periodically audit `.plans/` — any plan untouched for 14+ days should be reviewed. Either update its status, confirm it's still active, or delete it.

6. **No meeting notes in `.plans/`**: Raw transcripts and meeting notes go in `notes/` or issue comments, not `.plans/`. Plans must be actionable specs.

7. **No audit reports in `.plans/`**: Point-in-time audit findings go in issue comments or a separate `audits/` directory if needed for record-keeping, not mixed with implementation plans.

### Scope Discipline

Plans with >15 locked decisions likely need splitting. Separate **vision/architecture** documents (what and why) from **implementation plans** (how, in what order, with what tests).

| Document Type | Decision Count | Location |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Architecture spec | Unlimited | `docs/specs/` or issue |
| Implementation plan | 5-15 decisions | `.plans/` |
| Task checklist | 0 decisions | `.plans/*.todo.md` |

### Decision Log Best Practice

The numbered decision table with rationale is the most effective planning pattern in this repo. Every plan SHOULD include one:

```markdown
## Decision Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Direct Dexie persistence | Local-first principle; no server roundtrip |
| 2 | Yjs CRDT for sync | Conflict-free multi-peer collaboration |
```

This gives Claude and future contributors unambiguous constraints without reading 200 lines of prose.

## Part 6: When NOT to Plan

### Skip Planning For

| Scenario | Do Instead |
|----------|------------|
| Single-file bug fix with clear root cause | `/debug` -> fix -> test |
| Typo or copy changes | Direct edit |
| Config change (env var, build flag) | Direct edit -> verify build |
| Adding a test for existing behavior | `testing` skill directly |
| Formatting or lint fix | `bun format && bun lint` |

### Signs a Plan is Needed

| Signal | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Touches 3+ packages | Cross-package coordination needed |
| Changes shared modules | Downstream app/extension implications |
| Changes data model | Dexie schema migration + sync implications |
| New user-facing feature | UX decisions + offline behavior |
| Breaking change | Blast radius analysis + migration path |

### Planning Traps to Avoid

- **Over-planning polish work** — Small UI tweaks don't need 10-step plans
- **Planning without reading code first** — Always audit existing patterns before writing a plan
- **Planning what you don't understand** — Use `/debug` to investigate first
- **Stale plans** — If a plan sits untouched for 14+ days, reassess before executing
- **Vision creep** — Keep architecture exploration separate from implementation plans; a plan with 60 decisions is a spec, not a plan

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Planning without requirements** — Every plan step must trace to a requirement; if you can't articulate the requirement, you're not ready to plan
- **Plans with vague steps** — "Update the component" is not a plan step; "Add publish handler to `ReviewPanel` that calls `publishToFeed()`" is
- **Skipping impact analysis** — A plan without "Files to Modify" will surprise you during execution
- **Infinite planning** — If the plan exceeds 15 steps, split into multiple plans or incremental PRs
- **Planning alone when blocked** — If you need information to plan, ask the user directly instead of guessing
- **Ignoring CLAUDE.md compliance** — Plans that skip the compliance checklist produce non-conforming code
- **Plan proliferation** — Never have 2+ active plans for the same feature. When a new plan supersedes an old one, delete the old one immediately
- **Missing test strategy** — Every feature plan needs a "Test Strategy" section
- **Write-only plans** — Plans that are never updated after creation become misleading. Update status or add divergence notes as work progresses
- **Mixed content in `.plans/`** — Meeting notes, audit snapshots, and team prompts are not plans. Keep `.plans/` for actionable implementation specs only

## Validation Commands

```bash
bun format && bun lint && bun run test && bun build
```

## Key Principles

- **100% requirement coverage** — Every requirement mapped
- **Evidence before claims** — Verify before marking done
- **Batch execution** — Pause for feedback
- **Right-size the plan** — Match planning depth to task complexity
