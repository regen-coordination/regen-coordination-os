# R&D

This page summarizes the active research and technical risk lanes rather than reproducing the entire
long-form audits.

## Highest-Priority Architecture Risks

The current reference docs repeatedly point to the same core issues:

- CRDT correctness where shared arrays are still written too coarsely
- remotely hosted WASM that weakens offline and extension-distribution guarantees
- fixed-interval polling that burns battery and CPU
- missing evaluation harnesses for the agent
- weak eventing between contexts compared with a typed bus model

## Near-Term Research Lanes

- make the sync model more correct before adding more autonomy
- improve model loading, capability detection, and fallback behavior
- extract monolithic runtime files into clearer handlers and interfaces
- improve storage quota awareness and blob lifecycle handling

## Longer-Horizon Work

- event-driven scheduling instead of constant polling
- compositional prompts and lazy skill loading
- portability toward other shells
- richer tool and interop layers around the agent model
