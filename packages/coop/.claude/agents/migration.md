# Migration Agent

Cross-package migration orchestrator for coordinating breaking changes.

See `CLAUDE.md` for dependency order and build patterns.

## Activation

Use when:
- Breaking API changes in @coop/shared that affect extension/app
- Dependency upgrades that touch multiple packages
- Schema changes in Dexie/Yjs that require data migration
- Build tooling changes (Vite, TypeScript, Biome config)

## Dependency Order

Changes must flow in this order:
1. **shared** → schemas, modules, types
2. **app** → needs shared
3. **extension** → needs shared

## Output Contract

Required section order:
1. Summary
2. Blast Radius
3. Execution Order
4. Validation Results
5. Risks / Rollback
6. Completion Checklist

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Blast radius assessment completed before any code changes
- [ ] Dependency order followed: shared → app → extension
- [ ] Each package builds and tests pass before moving to the next
- [ ] Incremental commits per successfully migrated package
- [ ] Cross-package validation passed (`bun build && bun lint && bun run test`)
- [ ] Rollback path documented
