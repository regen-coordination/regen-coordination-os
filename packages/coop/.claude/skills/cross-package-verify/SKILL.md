# Cross-Package Verify Skill

Thin wrapper around canonical review/output standards for multi-package verification.

- Canonical review protocol: `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`

## Activation

Use for:
- `/review --mode verify_only --scope cross-package`
- "verify all packages"
- "cross-package verify"
- "parallel verification"

Explicit fix mode requires user phrase: "apply fixes" or "autonomous review".

## Part 1: Deterministic Modes

- Default mode: `verify_only`
- Fix mode: `apply_fixes` only with explicit user intent

Verification sequence:
1. Execute package checks in dependency order (shared -> app -> extension)
2. Report by severity/action bucket
3. Stop unless explicit fix-mode trigger is present

## Part 2: Verification Baseline

Minimum checks by package scope:

```bash
bun lint
bun run test
bun build
```

## Part 3: Output Format

Use this exact ordered structure:

### Summary
- Packages verified
- Mode used (`verify_only` or `apply_fixes`)

### Severity Mapping
- `Critical|High -> must-fix`
- `Medium -> should-fix`
- `Low -> nice-to-have`

### Must-Fix
- Blocking regressions and broken contracts

### Should-Fix
- Important quality gaps

### Nice-to-Have
- Non-blocking improvements

### Verification
- Commands and outcomes per package

### Recommendation
- `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`

## Anti-Patterns

- Entering fix mode without explicit user trigger
- Skipping dependency-order verification
- Reporting without severity-to-action mapping
- Omitting package-by-package verification evidence

- `autonomous-review` — explicit review-and-fix flow
- `testing` — validation strategy per package
