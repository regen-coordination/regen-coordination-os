# Audit Skill

Systematic codebase analysis: quality audit, dead code detection, architectural review.

**References**: See `CLAUDE.md` for codebase patterns.

**Context mode**: `context: fork` means this skill runs in an isolated subagent context. The agent gets a read-only snapshot of the codebase — it should never edit files during an audit. If findings require fixes, report them in the output and let the user decide when to act.

---

## Activation

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/audit` | Full codebase audit |
| `/audit [package]` | Targeted package audit |
| Before refactoring | Identify tech debt |
| Periodic assessment | Codebase health check |

## Progress Tracking (REQUIRED)

Use **TodoWrite** when available. If unavailable, keep a Markdown checklist in the response. See `CLAUDE.md` -> Session Continuity.

---

## Part 0: Previous Findings Verification

**REQUIRED before any new analysis.** Check whether previously reported Critical and High issues are still open.

### Steps

1. **Find the most recent audit report**:
```bash
ls -t .plans/audits/*-audit.md | head -1
```

2. **Read** the report and extract all Critical and High findings with their file:line references.

3. **Re-verify** each finding — read the cited file and confirm whether the issue is still present, fixed, or changed.

4. **Count consecutive open cycles** for each finding. Track how many consecutive audits each finding has been STILL OPEN (check the Trend table and Previous Findings tables from prior reports).

5. **Apply escalation** per the Severity Escalation table below. This is NOT optional — if a finding has been open 3+ cycles and is not ACCEPTED/DEFERRED, it MUST be escalated. If open 5+ cycles, it MUST appear in the Executive Summary as chronic.

6. **Carry forward** the Previous Findings Status table with updated statuses: `STILL OPEN`, `FIXED`, `PARTIALLY FIXED`, `Downgraded to [severity]`, `ACCEPTED`, or `DEFERRED`.
   - `ACCEPTED`: User explicitly decided the finding is acceptable as-is (stops escalation)
   - `DEFERRED`: Fix requires major effort; user chose to defer (stops escalation, include rationale)

---

## Part 1: Automated Analysis

Run these checks and capture output for use in later parts:

```bash
# Type checking — run per package
cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit
cd packages/app && npx tsc --noEmit
cd packages/extension && npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
bun lint

# TODO/FIXME markers
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" packages/
```

A passing check means zero output or exit code 0. Flag any failures as findings in Part 2.

---

## Part 2: File-by-File Review

For each file check:
1. **Deprecations** — outdated patterns, old APIs
2. **Unfinished work** — TODO comments
3. **Architectural violations** (see CLAUDE.md):
   - Business logic in app/extension (must be in shared)
   - Package-level .env files
4. **Type problems** — `any`, `unknown`, type assertions
5. **Code smells** — long functions, deep nesting

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Security issues, data loss risk
- **HIGH**: Bugs, broken functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Tech debt, maintainability
- **LOW**: Style, minor improvements

### Severity Escalation (REQUIRED)

Findings that remain open across multiple audit cycles auto-escalate:

| Consecutive Audits Open | Action |
|--------------------------|--------|
| 1-2 | Report at assigned severity |
| 3+ | **Escalate one level** (LOW->MEDIUM, MEDIUM->HIGH). Note `(escalated from X, open N cycles)` |
| 5+ | **Flag in Executive Summary** as chronic. Recommend dedicated refactoring task or acceptance decision |

Escalation does NOT apply to:
- Findings explicitly **accepted** by the user (mark as `ACCEPTED` in Previous Findings Status)
- Structural findings where the fix requires a major refactoring effort (mark as `DEFERRED` with rationale)
- Findings that are blocked by an upstream dependency or third-party limitation

To stop escalation, the user must explicitly mark a finding as `ACCEPTED` or `DEFERRED` in the Previous Findings table. Absent that, escalation applies automatically.

---

## Part 3: Dead Code Detection

### Automated Tooling (REQUIRED -- always run before manual review)

> **IMPORTANT**: Always use `knip` for dead code detection.
> It understands TypeScript's module resolution and monorepo workspace relationships.
> **NEVER rely on grep-based scanning** for unused export detection — it has ~80% false-positive
> rate in monorepos due to barrel exports, re-exports, and aliased imports.

```bash
# knip — monorepo-aware unused files, exports, deps, types
bunx knip                          # Full analysis (files, exports, deps, types)
bunx knip --reporter compact       # Condensed output
bunx knip --include files          # Only unused files
bunx knip --include exports        # Only unused exports
bunx knip --include dependencies   # Only unused deps
```

### Manual Detection (fallback only -- prefer knip)

Only use grep-based detection when automated tools cannot run (e.g., non-TypeScript files):

1. **Identify exports**: `grep -n "export " [file]`
2. **Search for usage**: `grep -rn "[export-name]" packages/`
3. **Categorize**:
   - **Dead**: No usage
   - **Possibly Dead**: Only test usage
   - **Active**: Used across codebase

---

## Part 4: Architectural Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Detection |
|--------------|-----------|
| God Objects | Files > 500 lines |
| Circular Deps | Import cycles |
| Layer Violations | Wrong import direction |

### Coop Violations

```bash
# Business logic outside shared
grep -rn "^export.*function\|^export.*const.*=.*=>" packages/app/src packages/extension/src --include="*.ts" | grep -v "component\|view\|runtime"

# Package .env files
find packages -name ".env*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"
```

---

## Part 5: Self-Validation (REQUIRED before Part 6)

Before generating the final report, re-verify EVERY finding from Parts 1-4:

1. **Re-read** the flagged file at the cited line number
2. **Confirm** the code matches what you described in the finding
3. **Check context** — read 10 lines above/below for guards, comments, or patterns that invalidate the finding
4. **Assign confidence**: `HIGH` (verified in code) / `MEDIUM` (likely but context unclear) / `LOW` (might be false positive)
5. **Drop LOW confidence findings** — do not include them in the report. If you're not sure, it's not a finding.
6. **Verify escalation compliance** — for each STILL OPEN finding, count consecutive open cycles and confirm:
   - 3+ cycles -> severity bumped one level (unless ACCEPTED/DEFERRED)
   - 5+ cycles -> appears in Executive Summary as **chronic**
   - If escalation was NOT applied, fix it before generating the report

### Team Mode Addition

When using `--team`, the lead agent MUST re-read every finding from sub-agents before synthesis. Sub-agents may have read stale working tree state modified by other agents. Any finding the lead cannot verify gets dropped.

---

## Part 6: Report Generation

Create at `.plans/audits/[date]-audit.md`:

```markdown
# Audit Report - [Date]

## Executive Summary
- **Packages analyzed**: [list]
- **Critical**: N | **High**: N | **Medium**: N | **Low**: N
- **Dead code**: N unused files, N unused exports, N unused exported types, N unused deps
- **Lint warnings**: N (breakdown)
- **Architectural violations**: N
- **Mode**: Single-agent | Team

---

## Previous Findings Status

_Tracked from: [previous audit date]_

### Critical Findings
| ID | Finding | File | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|------|--------|-------|

### High Findings
| ID | Finding | File | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|------|--------|-------|

### Medium Findings resolved since last audit
| ID | Finding | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|-------|

---

## High Findings

### H1. [Title] ([STILL OPEN | NEW])
- **File**: `package/path/to/file.ts:line`
- **Issue**: [Description]
- **Recommendation**: [Action]

---

## Medium Findings

### M1. [Title]
- **File**: `package/path/to/file.ts:line`
- **Issue**: [Description]

---

## Low Findings

### L1. [Title]
- [Brief description with file:line]

---

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Location | Lines | Cycles Open | Severity |
|--------------|----------|-------|-------------|----------|

---

## Trend (last N audits)

| Metric | [date1] | [date2] | [current] |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Critical | N | N | **N** |
| High | N | N | **N** |
| Medium | N | N | **N** |
| Low | N | N | **N** |
| Unused files | N | N | **N** |
| Unused exports | N | N | **N** |
| Unused types | N | N | **N** |
| Unused deps | N | N | **N** |
| Findings fixed | -- | N | **N** |
| Findings opened | -- | N | **N** |
| Resolution velocity | -- | N/N | **N/N** |

> **Resolution velocity** = findings fixed / findings opened in the period.
> Values >1.0 indicate debt is shrinking; <1.0 means debt is growing.

**Observations**: [Key trends, what improved, what regressed]

---

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **[Action]** -- [context] (Severity, finding ID)
2. **[Action]** -- [context] (Severity, finding ID)
```

---

## Part 7: Team Mode

When `--team` is passed, spawn a parallel agent team instead of running sequentially.

**Requires**: The Agent tool must be available in the current session to spawn teammates.
If the Agent tool is unavailable (check tool list), fall back to single-agent mode and note
`Mode: Single-agent (Agent tool unavailable)` in the Executive Summary.

### Team Structure

```
Lead (Part 0 + Parts 5-7 -- validation, report, drift)
  shared-auditor      (shared -- Parts 1-4)
  app-auditor         (app -- Parts 1-4)
  extension-auditor   (extension -- Parts 1-4)
```

### Lead Responsibilities

1. Run **Part 0** (Previous Findings Verification) before spawning teammates
2. Spawn teammates with package-scoped instructions
3. Wait for all teammates to complete
4. Run **Part 5** (Self-Validation) on all teammate findings
5. **Synthesize** findings into single report (Part 6)
6. Write final report to `.plans/audits/[date]-audit.md`

### Spawn Prompts

**shared-auditor:**
```
Audit packages/shared. Run Parts 1-4 of the audit skill scoped to shared.
Use `bunx knip --workspace @coop/shared`. Check for god objects (>500 lines),
`as any` assertions, and module patterns. Report all findings with
severity and file:line references. Do NOT edit any files.
IMPORTANT: Only read files in packages/shared. Do NOT read files in other packages --
another agent handles those. Cross-package findings should be noted as
"needs cross-package verification" rather than stated as confirmed.
```

**app-auditor:**
```
Audit packages/app. Run Parts 1-4 of the audit skill scoped to app.
Use `bunx knip --workspace @coop/app`. Check for business logic outside shared,
dead components, unused dependencies. Report all findings with severity and
file:line references. Do NOT edit any files.
IMPORTANT: Only read files in packages/app. Do NOT read files in other packages.
```

**extension-auditor:**
```
Audit packages/extension. Run Parts 1-4 of the audit skill scoped to extension.
Use `bunx knip --workspace @coop/extension`. Check for business logic outside shared,
MV3 compatibility, dead components, unused dependencies. Report all findings with
severity and file:line references. Do NOT edit any files.
IMPORTANT: Only read files in packages/extension. Do NOT read files in other packages.
```

### When to Use Team Mode

| Scenario | Mode |
|----------|------|
| Quick health check on one package | `/audit shared` (single agent) |
| Full codebase audit | `/audit --team` (parallel) |
| Pre-release audit | `/audit --team` (parallel, thorough) |
| Checking a specific concern | `/audit [package]` (single agent) |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Flag build output as dead code | Build artifacts, not source code |
| Report god objects in multiple report sections | Use Architectural Anti-Patterns table only; reference it from findings |
| Use grep to detect unused exports | ~80% false-positive rate due to barrel re-exports |
| Include LOW-confidence findings | Self-validation gate exists for a reason -- drop them |
| Edit files during an audit | Read-only mode; report findings, let user decide on fixes |
| State cross-package findings as confirmed | If you can't see the consumer, mark "needs cross-package verification" |
| Skip the Previous Findings check | Trend tracking is the audit's most valuable output over time |

---

## Key Principles

- **Complete all files** — never skip
- **Read-only mode** — don't edit during audit
- **Evidence-based** — every finding needs file:line
- **Prompt before issues** — ask user before creating GitHub issues
- **Check for drift** — verify skill references match actual codebase
