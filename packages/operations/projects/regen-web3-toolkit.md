# Regen Web3 Toolkit

**Status**: Develop · **Lead**: Luiz Fernando · **Repo**: [explorience/regen-toolkit](https://github.com/explorience/regen-toolkit) · **Site**: [regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app](https://regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app)

## Vision

A layered knowledge and coordination system for regenerative web3 and local ecosystem building. At the surface, an educational and navigation tool; underneath, a system that connects knowledge, real-world projects, design options, deployment constraints, and ontology — so people can not only learn ideas but also apply them in coherent ways.

In one sentence: **a regenerative web3 knowledge garden that doubles as a design and deployment framework**.

## Three concurrent goals

1. **Public-facing knowledge base** — 254 articles in inventory, 67 drafted and deployed, 5 learning paths, knowledge explorer, tag explorer, editorial pipeline.
2. **Mapping and resource layer** — aggregates projects, organizations, people, tools, papers, ecosystem references across ReFi, governance, localism, mechanism design.
3. **Coordination architecture** — not just a library of ideas but a structured system for helping groups choose models, understand tradeoffs, and deploy them with clarity.

## System architecture (8 layers)

| # | Layer | Function | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resource Graph | Reality-grounding — projects, orgs, people, places, papers, tools, maps | Brandon + TBD curator |
| 2 | Encyclopedia | Structured knowledge — concepts, frameworks, articles, learning paths | Heenal |
| 3 | Ontology | Semantic backbone — entity types, relationships, classifications (spans all layers) | Matt (ops taxonomy) + Luiz (architecture) |
| 4 | Option Library | Design components — governance, coordination, funding, incentives, measurement | Luiz; unowned in practice |
| 5 | Deployment | Structural constraint — decision, info, power, accountability, failure detection, classification | Luiz + Durgadas (CSIS upstream) |
| 6 | Tracks | Application compositions — audience/context-specific pathways | Heenal |
| 7 | Implementations | Real deployments — local nodes, pilots, campaigns, case studies | Unowned |
| 8 | Feedback & Evolution | System update — capture → classify → review → update → communicate → version | Unowned |

**Flow:** Resource Graph → Encyclopedia → Option Library → Deployment → Tracks → Implementations → Feedback → back into all prior layers. **Ontology** cross-cuts everything.

## CSIS conformance posture

The Regen Toolkit is *not* a CSIS implementation. It is a broader knowledge, design, and deployment system that is increasingly informed by CSIS as a structural integrity framework. CSIS is applied most directly in the **Deployment Layer** (options/tracks must translate into explicit structural conditions), and secondarily in the **Feedback Layer** (tensions, failures, adaptations are surfaced and integrated).

Open architectural gaps flagged in the master doc:
- Compressive vs generative standards not yet explicit
- Capacity-building conditions, shared understanding, and conflict transformation not separated from structural constraints
- No assessment/conformance posture (partial adoption vs full conformance)

## Extracted artifacts

Structured extractions from the master doc live alongside canonical org-os data:

- **Ontology entities** — `data/ontology/regen-toolkit-entities.yaml` (15 core types + extensions)
- **Ontology relationships** — `data/ontology/regen-toolkit-relationships.yaml`
- **Classification layers** — `data/ontology/regen-toolkit-classification.yaml` (9 cross-cutting attributes)
- **Octo/SuperBenefit interop mapping** — `data/ontology/regen-toolkit-octo-mapping.yaml`
- **Option Library taxonomy** — `data/option-library.yaml` (9 categories)
- **Deployment requirements** — `data/deployment-requirements.yaml` (6 structural components + invalid conditions)
- **Feedback process** — `data/feedback-process.yaml` (5-step loop + governance)

## Backlog

Explicit todos extracted from master doc → `docs/projects/regen-toolkit/BACKLOG.md` (11 items, CSIS integration + validation + resource audit).

## Current sprint status (from master doc, dated 2026-03-25/26)

- 67 articles drafted and deployed via 5-stage editorial pipeline (research → writing → fact-checking → editing → critique)
- Astro/Starlight site deployed at regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app
- Knowledge Explorer with 5 learning paths live (Newcomer 21, Community Org 23, Local Chapter 17, Governance 14, Environmental 20)
- Matt's ontology integrated as structured frontmatter metadata
- Mapping Infrastructure doc (Brandon's) incorporated into writing system

**Next phases:**
- Phase 2 — expand 43 medium articles through editorial pipeline
- Phase 3 — write 139 stub articles from scratch
- Apply Matt's feedback on 4 articles (scams, seed phrases, wallet comparison, key terms)
- Add real-world examples from approved source maps (Restor, Hylo, P2P Foundation, ReFi Ecosystem, Weavers Network, Second Renaissance)
- Human review of all published drafts

## Unresolved design decisions

From the master doc, still needing your call:

1. **Canonical architecture version** — doc contains 3 variants (detailed Layer 1–8 spec, 7-layer summary, 6-layer team map). Pick one canonical, mark others as accessible summaries.
2. **Ontology resolution** — Version A (Octo-aligned, interop-first) vs Version B (CSIS-optimized, structure-first). Doc recommends v1 as base + v2b as semantic overlay. Formalize.
3. **Resource dump consolidation** — 11+ domain URL lists (~3,900 lines) in master doc; not yet lifted to structured `resources.yaml`.
4. **Taxonomy vs Ontology distinction** — flagged for conceptual clarity in master doc line 181.
