# Coop Architecture

Coop is a Bun monorepo with thin runtime packages and a strong shared domain layer. The architecture
is optimized around one idea: keep capture, review, sync, and bounded execution legible across the
browser surfaces.

## Runtime Split

| Surface | Main Role |
| --- | --- |
| Extension | Primary node for capture, review, publish, sync, and operator work |
| App | Public landing plus receiver PWA shell |
| API server | Signaling relay and minimal support routes |
| Shared package | Schemas, flows, storage, identity, archive, policy, onchain, privacy, agent modules |

## Data Layers

Coop deliberately uses different storage layers for different jobs:

- Dexie on top of IndexedDB for structured local persistence
- Yjs for shared CRDT state
- y-indexeddb for local persistence of Yjs docs
- y-webrtc for peer-to-peer transport
- Filecoin-backed archive flows for durable receipts and provenance

## The Product Loop In Architecture Terms

1. Capture enters as tabs, receiver assets, or observations.
2. Local draft state lives in Dexie until a human publishes.
3. Publish writes shared artifacts into the coop's Yjs-backed state.
4. Sync propagates that state across peers.
5. Optional archive actions attach durable receipts to artifacts and snapshots.

## Major Shared Modules

Some of the most important shared modules are:

- `auth` for passkey-first identity and onchain auth
- `coop` for core workflow, feed, board, and publish logic
- `storage` for Dexie and Yjs persistence
- `archive` for Storacha and Filecoin flows
- `policy`, `session`, `permit`, and `operator` for bounded execution
- `agent` for observations, skills, and local automation
- `receiver` for the app-side capture and pairing model

## Architectural Rules That Matter In Practice

- keep runtime packages thin
- treat explicit publish as a product boundary
- keep one shared contract layer instead of re-defining types per package
- avoid deep imports when a module already exports a public surface
- preserve mock and live mode paths for onchain and archive integrations

## Where To Go Deeper

- Read [Coop Extension](/builder/extension) for the MV3 runtime breakdown.
- Read [Coop App](/builder/app) for the landing and receiver shell split.
- Read [P2P Functionality](/builder/p2p-functionality) for sync transport details.
- Read [Reference: Coop OS Architecture](/reference/coop-os-architecture-vnext) for the long-form
  source document.
