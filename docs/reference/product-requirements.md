# Coop - Product Requirements Document

**Version**: 0.0 (Pre-Release)
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-13
**Status**: Living document derived from codebase audit

---

## 1. Product Vision

Coop is a **browser-first, local-first knowledge commons** that helps communities turn scattered online knowledge into shared intelligence and coordinated action. Built on Ethereum principles (self-sovereignty, censorship resistance, privacy by default), Coop enables groups to capture, review, publish, and archive knowledge without central servers or custodial providers.

### Mission
Enable communities to coordinate around knowledge, including funding leads, evidence, governance insights, and ecosystem signals, without extraction, surveillance, or centralized gatekeeping.

### Alignment
Coop implements the Ethereum Foundation's March 2026 Mandate (CROPS: Censorship Resistance, Open Source, Privacy, Security) through passkey-first identity, P2P sync, local-first data, and durable Filecoin archiving.

#### US-12.2: Notification Preferences
**As a** receiver user,
**I want to** control browser notifications,
**So that** I'm alerted to important events without spam.

**Notification Events**:
- Receiver paired
- First sync completed
- Sync failure (individual capture)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Permission requested on first toggle
- Tags prevent duplicate notifications
- Disabled gracefully if permission denied
- Works on both desktop and mobile browsers

### Key Security Properties

| Property | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| Identity | Passkey (WebAuthn), no custodial keys |
| Data at rest | IndexedDB (browser sandbox) |
| Data in transit | WebRTC (DTLS encryption) |
| Invite integrity | HMAC-SHA256 proof |
| Session encryption | AES-GCM with PBKDF2 (120K iterations) |
| Archive integrity | Content-addressing (IPFS CIDs) |
| Smart sessions | ERC-4337 with time + usage limits |
| Permit delegation | Time-bound, usage-limited, revocable |

### Known Limitations

1. CRDT updates are schema-validated but not author-authenticated. A compromised peer can inject valid-looking data.
2. Room secret is the sole trust boundary for sync. If leaked, unauthorized peers can read/write.
3. Local inference model quality depends on device capability (WebGPU)

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Extension sidepanel loads < 500ms
- Tab capture completes < 2s per tab
- CRDT sync latency < 1s (same network)
- Local inference < 60s timeout (with fallback)
- Board graph renders < 3s for 50-node graphs

### Reliability
- All captures survive browser crashes (IndexedDB persistence)
- Sync automatically retries on failure (exponential backoff)
- Offscreen document keeps sync alive when sidepanel closed
- Service worker restarts on crash

### Compatibility
- Chrome 120+ (MV3 requirement)
- Mobile browsers: Safari 16+, Chrome 120+ (PWA)
- Chains: Arbitrum One, Ethereum Sepolia

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatible (ARIA labels, landmarks)
- Reduced motion support
- Color contrast meets AA ratios
- Touch targets >= 44x44px
