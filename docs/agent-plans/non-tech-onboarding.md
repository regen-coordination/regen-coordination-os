## Goal

Enable non-technical operators to bootstrap and interact with org-os without GitHub/CLI knowledge. Progressive disclosure: chat → web dashboard → guided bootstrap → CLI.

## Open Questions

- Which platform for the web wizard? (GitHub Pages static form → Actions backend? Separate hosted service?)
- How to handle authentication for member-level actions on webapps?
- Should the Telegram bot interface be standardized at framework level or remain instance-specific?

## Rough Tasks

- [ ] Write `docs/OPERATOR-GUIDE.md` — what you can do via chat, web, CLI
- [ ] Write `docs/CHAT-INTERFACE.md` — Telegram/chat bot interface spec
- [ ] Design web bootstrap wizard flow (maps to bootstrap-interviewer questions)
- [ ] Add `deploy:pages` config to all webapp packages (GitHub Pages ready)
- [ ] Add shared navigation header across dashboard, ideation-board, aggregator
- [ ] Add "Getting Started" section to README.md template for non-tech users
